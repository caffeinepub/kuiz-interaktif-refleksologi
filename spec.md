# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebuild and redeploy the existing reflexology quiz application in its current state without any changes.

**Planned changes:**
- Redeploy the backend Motoko actor with all existing question and result storage functions
- Rebuild and redeploy the frontend with all existing routes and functionality intact

**User-visible outcome:** The full application is restored and operational, with all routes (`/`, `/quiz`, `/admin`) accessible, the quiz flow working end to end, and the admin leaderboard displaying results correctly.
