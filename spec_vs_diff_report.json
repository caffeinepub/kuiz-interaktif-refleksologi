  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to 4 files: TopicSelector.tsx (frontend component), AdminPage.tsx (frontend page), frontend-file-summaries.txt (documentation), and project_state.json (state tracking). These changes appear to be a rebuild/redeploy of the existing application without feature changes. The modifications align with REQ-16's requirement to rebuild and redeploy the full application in its current state. The diff does not show backend Motoko actor changes, but the frontend components match described existing features. No new features appear to have been added, and no existing features appear removed.",
